### [PuppetConf 2016 Presentation](http://sched.co/6fjw)

---

Writing your first Puppet module is pretty daunting. There are so many things to set up: tools, repositories, tests! In this presentation we’ll walk through setting up a local Windows development environment, and then write a Puppet module. We’ll also look at debugging, testing and publishing the module to the Puppet Forge.
