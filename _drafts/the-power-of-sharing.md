# CAM + S ?
**TODO Carebear image**

Damon Edwards and John Willis coined the term [CAMS](http://itrevolution.com/devops-culture-part-1/) (Culture, Automation, Measurement and Sharing) back in 2010 at DevOpsDays Mountain View.  Since then, many people have written about Culture, and a vast number of tools have been created for Automation and Measurement.  However there is very little on the topic of Sharing. It’s obviously important otherwise it would be just CAM! Also it seems to be of equal importance otherwise it would be called CAMs.

**TODO** Segway into what does sharing mean

# What does sharing mean?

Culture, Automation and Measurement have a strong and obvious history...

* Culture - There is an entire branch of science dedicated to studying human society (Anthropology)

* Automation - There are vast array of companies offering automation products and workflows, with a large body of knowledge to help people apply automation correctly

* Measurement - Science has been teaching data gathering methods since the days of Gallileo (or even beyond!) and in more recent times Data Scientists are employed to help define, measure and analyse metrics.

But sharing does not seem to have same history, or at least as prevelant.  Granted, sharing could be considered a part of Society and Culture in general, e.g. story telling, but what does sharing mean in the context of DevOps?

[Patrick Debois](http://www.jedi.be/) gave a [talk](http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/devops-with-the-s-for-sharing-14764362) at [JAX London in 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2EVXvqwKwY) entitled;

> Devops with the S for Sharing
>
> ... Many devops talks relate to the CAMS acronym : Culture, Automation, Measuring and Sharing. The S for Sharing is usually taken for granted and does not get much explanation, but in this talk it will be right in the centre. Without Sharing there is no Devops and successful adoption is impossible.

Patrick gives a list of more than 50 facets that could and _should_ be shared in a company.  This presentation is fantastic and drives home exactly why Sharing is so important, and yet I was left wondering; This is great within a company or business "doing DevOps", but what about the wider DevOps Community? What about things such as blog posts and podcasts, where do they fit in? What about me as me as an individual, what's in it for me?

But this still didn't answer my original question of `What does sharing mean?`.  When all else fails, turn back to the dictionary;

```
Share [noun]
-  A part or portion of a larger amount that is divided among a number
   of people, or to which a number of people contribute

Share [verb] [with object]
- Use, occupy, or enjoy (something) jointly with another or others

- Possess (a view or quality) in common with others
```







# Sharing.  What's in it for me?

NOTES

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Care_Bear_characters

The Oxford dictionary has the following defintion of share

```
Share [noun]
-  A part or portion of a larger amount that is divided among a number of people, or to which a number of people contribute

Share [verb] [with object]
- Use, occupy, or enjoy (something) jointly with another or others

- Possess (a view or quality) in common with others
```

Why is sharing powerful? and how powerful can it be? In this ignite presentation we will look at why sharing is powerful and how it affected me; from the beginning of my DevOps journey through to moving with my family from Australia to Portland.

Notes:
I want to tell the story of how I went from doing desktop to support in Perth to a Windows Developer in Portland for a company synonymous with DevOps; and how this came about through other people sharing their Devops stories and information e.g.

About how important it is for people to share (CAMS ←- The S in CAMS) and how it inspires and affects people, even halfway across the globe

About how people should be aware that, other people in global devops community may not have the same physical opportunities to bond/chat etc. so building virtual communities is just as important to physical meetups, conferences etc..  Even things like it’s difficult for US people to go to EU based conferences and vice versa. Not to mention cultural differences.

Fear can stop sharing ← not sure about this point

What about the rubber duck theory (if you can’t explain your idea to a rubber duck, think more  ← not sure about this point
