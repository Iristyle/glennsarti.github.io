## The Care Bear Stare of the bears of DevOps-a-lot

The land of DevOps-a-lot was first created by Daemon Edwards and John Willis when they descended upon DevOpsDays Mountain View in 2010.  In this land are the magical four friends, The DevOps Care Bears!

1. Culture Bear loves all the people in DevOps-a-lot and wants them to be happy and motivated.

2. Automation Bear works hard to not only save time performing tasks in DevOps-a-lot but also helps to prevent mistakes, create consistency and enable self service.

3. Measurement Bear (Metrics for short) seeks to measure the things that are important to help the people of DevOps-a-lot make informed and transparent decisions.

4. Share Bear helps the people of DevOps-a-lot share similar experiences however and learn from each other.

Their most powerful weapon, the Care Bear Stare, is used to defeat the evil forces of Apathy, Blame, Mistrust and the most damning of all,Silos!


## "... Without Share Bear there is no DevOps-a-lot" - Patrick Debois (Heavily paraphrased!)

From the time Care-a-lot was first created to now, many people have written about Culture Bear, and a vast number of tools have been created to assist Automation Bear and Measurement Bear.  However, only the smallest sliver has been devoted to Share Bear. Many people just assume they know all there is to know about sharing.  Surely because we share every day so what is there to learn? Why should we care about Share Bear?

[Patrick Debois](http://www.jedi.be/) the Grand Wizard of DevOps-a-lot, gave a [talk](http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/devops-with-the-s-for-sharing-14764362) at [JAX London in 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2EVXvqwKwY) with the title:

> Devops with the S for Sharing
>
> ... Many devops talks relate to the CAMS acronym : Culture, Automation, Measuring and Sharing. The S for Sharing is usually taken for granted and does not get much explanation, but in this talk it will be right in the centre. Without Sharing there is no Devops and successful adoption is impossible.

Patrick gives a list of more than 50 facets that could and _should_ be shared by a company in DevOps-a-lot.  This presentation is fantastic and drives home exactly why sharing and Share Bear is so important, and yet I was left wondering; This is great for a company, but what about the broader community in DevOps-a-lot? What about things such as blog posts and podcasts, where do they fit in? What about me as me as an individual?

**TODO** Segway into what does sharing mean
But I share all the time, it's easy.  

# "... Without Sharing there is no Devops and successful adoption is impossible." - Patrick Debois

Culture, Automation and Measurement have a strong and obvious history...

* Culture - There is an entire branch of science dedicated to studying human society (Anthropology)

* Automation - There are vast array of companies offering automation products and workflows, with a large body of knowledge to help people apply automation correctly

* Measurement - Science has been teaching data gathering methods since the days of Gallileo (or even beyond!) and in more recent times Data Scientists are employed to help define, measure and analyse metrics.

But Sharing does not seem to have same history, or at least as prevelant.  Granted, sharing could be considered a part of Society and Culture in general, e.g. story telling, but what does sharing mean in the context of DevOps?

This presentation is fantastic and drives home exactly why Sharing is so important, and yet I was left wondering; This is great within a company/business practising DevOps, but what about the wider DevOps Community? What about things such as blog posts and podcasts, where do they fit in? What about me as me as an individual, what's in it for me?

### Off to the dictionary ....

So, when all else fails when trying to define something, turn to the dictionary! Here are some defintions of Share from the dictionary:
> Share [noun]
>
> -  A part or portion of a larger amount that is divided among a number of people, or to which a number of people contribute
>
> Share [verb] [with object]
> shared, sharing, shares
>
> - Use, occupy, or enjoy (something) jointly with another or others
>
> - Possess (a view or quality) in common with others

_- Oxford Dictionary_
{: .text-right}

So we can distill this down to:

> Sharing is to take something, such as your knowledge or experience, and distribute to a larger community, to it's benefit

But this still didn't help me.  This definition meant that I could only benefit if someone _else_ shared.  What benefit was there for _me_ by sharing?  What was in it for me?


# Different types of Sharing...

So perhaps instead of trying to define Sharing, I should look at the the different ways to Share. To clarify, I'm not just talking about the "Share ....." in Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc..  I'm also referring to blogs, podcasts, networking, [Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/);  pretty much any kind of social interaction.  After looking at many examples I narrowed it down to three categories:

* Realtime sharing
* Delayed sharing
* Unicast sharing

## Realtime Sharing


## Delayed Sharing


## Unicast Sharing

---
The definition has two aspects, one about consuming a portion from a larger amount "I took my share" and the other about contributing a portion to increase the amount; "I gave my share".

Besides the obvious comparison





A share is a portion of the whole..


Which means that if I'm in a DevOps community, then I am a portion of that community.

  This also has an interesting inverse implication;

_If I am a portion of the community, then if I leave, the community will be smaller/less because of me_





# Sharing.  What's in it for me?



Many years ago, my employer, [Bankwest](https://www.bankwest.com.au), facilitated 3 day workshops for all of the IT department, 600+ people at the time.  It was called Invigorated Thinking, and amongst many things, it used story telling in groups to

Share [verb] [with object]
- Use, occupy, or enjoy (something) jointly with another or others

Why is sharing powerful? and how powerful can it be? In this ignite presentation we will look at why sharing is powerful and how it affected me; from the beginning of my DevOps journey through to moving with my family from Australia to Portland.

Notes:
I want to tell the story of how I went from doing desktop to support in Perth to a Windows Developer in Portland for a company synonymous with DevOps; and how this came about through other people sharing their Devops stories and information e.g.

About how important it is for people to share (CAMS ←- The S in CAMS) and how it inspires and affects people, even halfway across the globe

About how people should be aware that, other people in global devops community may not have the same physical opportunities to bond/chat etc. so building virtual communities is just as important to physical meetups, conferences etc..  Even things like it’s difficult for US people to go to EU based conferences and vice versa. Not to mention cultural differences.

Fear can stop sharing ← not sure about this point

What about the rubber duck theory (if you can’t explain your idea to a rubber duck, think more  ← not sure about this point

Abstract:

Damon Edwards and John Willis coined the term CAMS (Culture, Automation, Measurement and Sharing) back in 2010 at DevOpsDays Mountain View.  Since then, many people have written about Culture, and a vast number of tools have been created for Automation and Measurement.  However there is very little on the topic of Sharing. It’s obviously important otherwise it would be just CAM! Why is sharing powerful? and how powerful can it be? In this ignite presentation we will look at why sharing is powerful and how it affected me; from the beginning of my DevOps journey through to moving with my family from Australia to Portland.
