Hi! I'm originally from Perth (Western Australia), but in December 2015, moved with my family to Portland (Oregon, United States) to work at Puppet. I have spent well over a decade as a Windows Client and Infrastructure engineer, with a heavy focus of automation and infrastructure software development.  But I was also a co-organiser for the DevOps meetup in Perth and have spoken at the Perth Dot Net, Java and DevOps meetups.

I'm also a contributor to [Neo4j](http://neo4j.com), helping out with management of Neo4j on Windows.
