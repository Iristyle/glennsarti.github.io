Hi! I'm originally from Perth (Western Australia), but in December 2015, my family and I made the big move to Portland (Oregon, United States), where I now work at [Puppet](http://puppet.com) as Senior Software Developer on the Windows team.

I have spent well over a decade as a Windows Client and Infrastructure engineer, with a heavy focus on automation and infrastructure software development. I was also a co-organiser for the DevOps meetup in Perth and have spoken at the Perth Dot Net, Java and DevOps meetups.

I'm also a contributor to [Neo4j](http://neo4j.com), helping out with management of Neo4j on Windows.
